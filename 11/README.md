# Day 10
## Part 1
Part 1 was relatively simple, just [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with tweaked rules and holes in the board. I'll get around to cleaning the code after I finish everything.
## Part 2
Part 2 should have been simple (just another tweak to the rules), but I misunderstood the rules for this version initially and had to run it on the sample input to figure out my mistake.
