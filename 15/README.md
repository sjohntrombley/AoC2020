# Day 15

The goal is the find the `m`^th number in a sequence generated by the following rules. Let `n` be the sequence and `n[i]` represent the `i`^th element of the sequence:

* The sequence starts with a given finate sequence of integers
* `n[i+1]` is `0` if `n[i]` doesn't appear in `n` before index `i`, and `i-j` otherwise, where `n[j]==n[i]` and, for all `k` such that `j<k<i`, `n[k]/=n[i]`.

# Part 1

Part 1 is to find the 2020^th element of the sequence. 2020 is a small enough number you can just generate the sequence up to that point.

# Part 2

Part 2 is to find the 30,000,000^th element of the sequence. The combination of the memory requirements needed to store the first 30 million elements of the sequence plus the overhead introduced by laziness (which, admittedly, can be accounted for) makes just generating the first 30 million elements in memory and searching the entire list each time inefficient. I switched to a `Map` that recorded the last index each unique element was found at, then used to it to reduce the space and
time complexity of calculating elements of the sequence. It still needs some work, as it currently takes ~90 seconds to run.
